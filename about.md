### Elaine Who?

I seek experiences that push me to unknown limits, humble me, and shatter my comfort level. From washing rugs with my Bediuon homestay family in Jordan to cycling along the coast from SF to LA. I have a personality larger than my size and a list of passions, hopes and dreams longer than ____.

Technology, coding and creatively creating magic with computers is my current focus. My weapon of choice include Ruby, Javascript/jQuery, and ActiveRecord. (However, I can be convinced otherwise.)

My career began with [New Sector's non-profit consulting fellowship](http://www.newsector.org), until I recognized that the level of geekism and pace in tech was more suitable. After supporting [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com) users and developers as a Support Engineer, I found an urge to do more with code. I transitioned to software engineering with through the intensity of [DevBootcamp](http://www.devbootcamp.com) and am loving every moment of coding.

Ask me where I'm from and I will give a hesitant look as I gauge your true interest to the answer. In short, I'm a New Yorker at heart, raised in an American bubble in Taipei, Taiwan.

Currently, I reside in San Francisco. The rest of my life story can shared over drinks.
