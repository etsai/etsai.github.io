<h3>Collection of Work from Dev Bootcamp -- <a href="https://github.com/etsai/DevBootcamp">Repo</a></h3>
This repo is a collection of the challenges and projects I've written throughout DevBootcamp. While I am proud of how much I've learnt and the work I've done, I also recognize that much of the code could be refactored and improved. This repo represents the journey and how I've progressed.

  <h3>Support Driven Documentation</h3>
    At Twilio, a large part of our documentation is written and maintained by the Support team. This talk explains the importance of having the support team own documentation and the ways to provide amazing documentation. This was a shorter, sweeter, revised verison of the talk <a href="https://twitter.com/negeorge" target="_blank">Nisha</a> and I presented at the Write the Docs conference.

  <h3>Translating Customer Interactions to Documentation</h3>
    Documentation has several benefits: centralizes knowledge, helps companies scale, and provides upfront information. This was a talk that <a href="https://twitter.com/negeorge" target="_blank">Nisha</a> and I gave at the 2013 Write the Docs conference about why it's important to have the Support team write documentation and how great documentation can be produced. A video of this talk can also be found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZPSn6uUC6s">here</a>

  <h3>Lightning Talk on Intro to Twilio TwiML</h3>
  Twilio's API is easy to use and the TwiML (Twilio Markup Language) used to make your web application talk is even simplier. I have personally found Twilio a great way to become more comfortable using API's and more confident in my coding. This was a 5 minute lightning talk I gave to introduce TwiML so beginner coders can see how they could start coding right away.
