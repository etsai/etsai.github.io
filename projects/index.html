  <h3>Jailbird -- <a href="jailbirdapp.com">Live</a> / <a href="https://github.com/mule-deer-2013/JailBirdApp">Repo</a></h3>
  Jailbird allows you contact your friends and family through SMS messaging or Voice calls with one telephone number. Next time you lose your phone, call Jailbird and get in touch in a jiffy. Technologies used to build this app include Twilio's API, Devise, Google Contacts API, jQuery, and Ruby on Rails.

  <h3>Twilio Live Coding Demo -- <a href="https://gist.github.com/etsai/8682643">Repo</a></h3>
  Live coding in front of a audience is one of the most difficult forms of public speaking. Your coding, infront of people, live, while introducing a topic and interacting with the audience. At Twilio, live coding at events is in our blood. We use it to show how quick and easy it is to get started and end with a bang by making the phones in the audience ring. I've live coded a number of times and this repo outlines my  code and general speaking notes. The code is written live in IRB.

  <h3>Collection of Work from Dev Bootcamp -- <a href="https://github.com/etsai/DevBootcamp">Repo</a></h3>
  Dev Bootcamp was a intensive project driven coding environment where I got to solve all sorts of challenges ranging from Sudoku to a Rails Survey application written thorough TDD. This repo is a collection of the challenges and projects I built during DevBootcamp. While I am proud of how much I've learnt and the work I've done, I also recognize that much of the code could be refactored and improved. This repo represents my journey and how I've progressed.

  <h3>Support Driven Documentation</h3>
    At Twilio, a large part of our documentation is written and maintained by the Support team. This talk explains the importance of having the support team manage documentation and the ways to provide amazing documentation. This was a shorter, sweeter, revised verison of the talk <a href="https://twitter.com/negeorge" target="_blank">Nisha George</a> and I presented at the 2013 Write the Docs conference.

  <h3>Translating Customer Interactions to Documentation</h3>
    Documentation has several benefits: centralizes knowledge, helps companies scale, and provides upfront information. This was a talk that <a href="https://twitter.com/negeorge" target="_blank">Nisha George</a> and I gave at the 2013 Write the Docs conference about why it's important to have the Support team write documentation and how great documentation can be produced. A video of this talk can also be found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZPSn6uUC6s">here</a>

  <h3>Lightning Talk on Intro to Twilio TwiML</h3>
  Twilio's API is easy to use and the TwiML (Twilio Markup Language) used to make your web application talk is even simplier. I have personally found Twilio a great way to become more comfortable using API's and more confident in my coding. This was a 5 minute lightning talk I gave to introduce TwiML so beginner coders can see how they could start coding right away.
