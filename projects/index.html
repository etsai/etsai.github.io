  <h3>Translating Customer Interactions to Documentation</h3>
  WriteTheDocs Conference: April 2013
  <br />
    Documentation has several benefits: centralizes knowledge, helps companies scale, and provides customers with upfront information. This was a talk that <a href="https://twitter.com/negeorge" target="_blank">Nisha George</a> and I gave at the 2013 Write the Docs conference about why it's important to have the Support team write documentation and how great documentation can be produced. A video of this talk can also be found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZPSn6uUC6s">here</a>

  <h3>Twilio Live Coding Demo -- <a href="https://gist.github.com/etsai/8682643">Repo</a></h3>
  Live coding in front of a audience is one of the most difficult forms of public speaking. You're coding and speaking in public, while introducing a topic and engaging with the audience. At Twilio, live coding at events is in our blood. We use it to show how quick and easy it is to get started and end with a bang by making the phones in the audience ring. I've live coded a number of times and this repo outlines my code and general speaking notes. The code is typed live in IRB.

  <h3>Collection of Work from Dev Bootcamp -- <a href="https://github.com/etsai/DevBootcamp">Repo</a></h3>
  Dev Bootcamp was a intensive project driven coding environment where I got to solve all sorts of challenges ranging from Sudoku to a Rails survey application written thorough TDD. This repo is a collection of the challenges and projects I built during DevBootcamp. While I am proud of how much I've learnt and the work I've done, I also recognize that much of the code could be refactored and improved. This repo represents my journey and how I've progressed.
