<h3>Collection of Work from Dev Bootcamp -- <a href="https://github.com/etsai/DevBootcamp">Repo</a></h3>
This repo is a collection of the challenges and projects I've written throughout DevBootcamp. While I am proud of how much I've learnt and the work I've done, I also recognize that much of the code could be refactored and improved. This repo represents the journey and how I've progressed.

  <h3>Support Driven Documentation</h3>
    At Twilio, a large part of our documentation is written and maintained by the Support team. This talk explains the importance of having the support team own documentation and the ways to provide amazing documentation.

  <h3>Translating Customer Interactions to Documentation</h3>
    Documentation has several benefits: centralizes knowledge, helps companies scale, and provides upfront information. This was a talk that Nisha and I gave at the Write the Docs conference about why it's important to have the Support team write documentation and how great documentation can be created by Support. A video of this talk can also be found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZPSn6uUC6s">here</a>

  <h3>Lightning Talk on Intro to Twilio TwiML</h3>
  Twilio's API is easy to use and the TwiML (Twilio Markup Language) available to make your web application talk is even simplier. I have personally found it a great way to become more comfortable using API's and more confident in my coding. This was a 5 minute lightning talk I gave during a Women Who Code meeting to introduce TwiML so that beginner coders can see how they could start coding right away.
